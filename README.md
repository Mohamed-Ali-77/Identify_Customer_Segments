Step 0: The Data

There are a number of files used for this project available in the workspace. It is strongly recommended that you complete and turn in this project from the workspace. As you will see from the agreement on the next page, if you choose to download a .zip file you will need to REMOVE the files from your computer via the agreement with Arvato Bartlesmann after completing the project, as the data are proprietary. The files available for the project are:

    Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
    Data_Dictionary.md: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
